This is my first Angular project. It's a simple To Do App.
At the moment of building it, features like Pipes, Routing or rxJS are not known, which made the building of the app a bit harder.

Improvements:

- Completed Tasks Page ( Using Routing )
- Edit Tasks
- Keyboard functionality ( Tab, Enter and Del )
